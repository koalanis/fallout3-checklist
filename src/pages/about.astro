      <p class="ml-4">
        This checklist website is inspired by a few things. First, this
        checklist is mainly inspired by
        <span class="italic">FALLOUT 3 WASTELAND CHECKLIST </span> by Logea, a pdf
        checklist that was promoted on reddit in this <Link
          href={url}
          label="post"
        />.
      </p>
      <p class="ml-4">
        Transitive thanks should be given as well: The format of this Fallout 3
        checklist is based on the Mass Effect Galactic Checklists by Teryx and
        ZimmMaster (formerly hosted at masseffect.shockfront.net). Many, many
        thanks to them!
