# fallout3-checklist
A 100+% Completionist Guide of the Capital Wasteland

Made with Astro ðŸš€!

## Disclaimer
This checklist website is inspired by a few things. First, this checklist is mainly inspired by _FALLOUT 3 WASTELAND CHECKLIST_ by Logea, a pdf checklist that was promoted on reddit in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/7z843q/i_made_a_fallout_3_fullcompletion_checklist/). 
Transitive thanks should be given as well: The format of this Fallout 3 checklist is based on the Mass Effect Galactic Checklists by Teryx and ZimmMaster (formerly hosted at masseffect.shockfront.net). Many, many thanks to them!
